# Wiggles Admin

Welcome to the Wiggles Admin project! This internal tool is designed to manage users of the Wiggles platform, facilitating tasks such as sending notifications to all users, handling spam accounts, and more.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main parts:

### Client (UI)

The client-side codebase, responsible for the user interface:

- **pages**:
  Unique pages of the admin interface. Each page should have its own file within this folder, keeping the codebase organized and easy to navigate.

- **components**:
  Reusable React components with `.jsx` extensions. Components here should be generic and reusable across different parts of the admin interface.

- **styles**:
  CSS files for styling the admin interface pages. Each page's styles should be contained within its own CSS file to maintain separation of concerns.

- **utils**:
  Utility functions and helper scripts. Any functions that are commonly used across the project should be placed here for easy access and reusability.

### Server

The server-side codebase, responsible for backend logic and API endpoints:

- **controllers**:
  Contains backend logic for various functionalities in separate files based on modules.

- **routes**:
  Defines API routes corresponding to the controller actions.

## Conventions

- Follow consistent coding conventions and adhere to the established folder structure.
- Use descriptive variable and function names to improve code readability.
- Document any complex or non-obvious code blocks with comments for future reference.
- Ensure that your code follows best practices and is well-documented.

## Team Collaboration

This project is being developed team Wiggles. Collaborate effectively by:

- Communicating regularly to coordinate tasks and share progress.
- Reviewing each other's code to ensure quality and consistency.
- Providing constructive feedback and assistance when needed.
